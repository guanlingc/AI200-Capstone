# Capstone Project for AI200

The purpose of this project is to apply the basics of machine learning using Scikit-Learn. 

### Problem statement
You work in a loan company that provides loans to people. The nature of this business has risk of lenders defaulting on loans. The company does not know who is more likely to default on the loans and has difficult time giving approval. 

### Proposed Solution 
The company keeps a record of each lender's profile. As a data professional with the company, you have been tasked to create a model to predict if a lender would default on the loan or not. 

### Solution's Impact
Accurately predicting a lender's ability to return the loan will reduce the amount of loans approved for bad lenders. This will reduce losses for the company.

### Remarks
The project was administered as a kaggle competition within the cohort. Each group was provided with a training and test set. 
predictions are submitted to kaggle where a AUC score is returned. 
Best score wins.
